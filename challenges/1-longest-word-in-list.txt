Write a function that, given a list of strings, returns the string which has the greatest character count (including duplicates).

You may assume that each string in the list is a single word.

function:
=========
name: longestInList

parameter: words: list of strings

return type: string

pseudo code:
============
set longest to first string in words

for each string word in words
	if word has more characters than longest
		set longest to word

return longest

test cases:
===========
(add some test cases yourself here!)
