Write a function that, given a list of numbers, returns the total (i.e. the result of adding up all the numbers in the list).

function:
=========
name: sumList

parameters:
	- NUMBERS: list of numbers

return type: number

pseudo code:
============
set RUNNING_TOTAL to 0

for each number, N, in NUMBERS
	increment RUNNING_TOTAL by N

return RUNNING_TOTAL

test cases:
===========
sumList([3, 10, 1]) should be 14
sumList([3, 10, 1, -4]) should be 10
sumList([0, 0, 0, 1]) should be 1
sumList([0, 0]) should be 0
